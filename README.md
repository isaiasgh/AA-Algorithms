# AA-Algorithms

This repository contains various algorithms learned in the **Analysis of Algorithms** course. It aims to provide efficient implementations of sorting, searching, and other classical algorithms in multiple programming languages (Python and Java).

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
AA-Algorithms
│── Sorting           # Sorting algorithms like BubbleSort, InsertionSort, etc.
│   ├── BubbleSort    # Individual algorithm folder
│   │   ├── Python    # Python implementation of BubbleSort
│   │   └── Java      # Java implementation of BubbleSort
│── Searching         # Searching algorithms like BinarySearch, etc.
│   ├── BinarySearch  # Individual algorithm folder
│   │   ├── Python    # Python implementation of BinarySearch
│   │   └── Java      # Java implementation of BinarySearch
│── README.md         # General repository information
```

Each algorithm has its own directory with separate folders for **Python** and **Java** implementations. In addition, each algorithm's folder contains a `README.md` file with a detailed explanation, time complexity analysis, and other relevant information.

## Notation Used

Throughout the repository, the following notation is commonly used:

- **A**: Array or List being sorted or searched.
- **p**: Starting index (usually used in algorithms like QuickSort).
- **r**: Ending index (usually used in algorithms like QuickSort).
- **n**: The size of the array/list or the problem instance.

## How to Use

To run an algorithm:

1. Navigate to the algorithm's directory (`Sorting`, `Searching`, etc.).
2. Go to the corresponding language folder (`Python` or `Java`).
3. Run the algorithm file (e.g., `python BubbleSort/Python/BubbleSort.py`).
